# Image_Seg
This project is a part of submissions to the CVIT task related to Image Segmentation.<br>
Report: Task 1 | Task 2 <br>
This code runs for both the tasks; task 1 which was <> and task 2 a novel extension of task 1 in order to <>. <br>
We can train from scratch, evaluate pre-trained models, and visualize the segmentation labels for ground truth and predictions with respect to task 1 and task 2.<br>
To train from scratch use the following command;<br>
<><br>
To test the pre-trained models or the trained model one can use the following command;<br>
<><br>
To visualize the ground truth or the predictions one can use the following command;<br>
<><br>
<br>
Here are a few plots of the loss functions;<br>
