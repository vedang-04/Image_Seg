# Image_Seg
This project is a part of submissions to the CVIT task related to Image Segmentation.
Report: Task 1 | Task 2
This code runs for both the tasks; task 1 which was <> and task 2 a novel extension of task 1 in order to <>.
We can train from scratch, evaluate pre-trained models, and visualize the segmentation labels for ground truth and predictions with respect to task 1 and task 2.
To train from scratch use the following command;
<>
To test the pre-trained models or the trained model one can use the following command;
<>
To visualize the ground truth or the predictions one can use the following command;
<>

Here are a few plots of the loss functions;
